# Where can I get help?

If you need help with Python, pip, or Docker, the first and best place to look is Google!

But if it's a Lute issue or question, the best places to ask for help are:

* the [Lute Discord](https://discord.gg/CzFUQP5m8u) "issues and bugs" channel.
* Lute v3 [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute-v3/issues)

When coming in with a question, please be as specific with your details as possible.

Good luck!
